# Project on Connected Components (graph)
This project took place during our class on Database Management at Ecole Polytechnique. It consisted in writing a PySpark algorithm to find the number of connected components in a graph. The algorithms were run on a Rosetta Hub cluster.

# Datasets
We applied the algorithms on several graphs datasets of different sizes (collected from the SNAP Standford website) such as:
- Wikipedia Vote Network
- Web Google Graph
- Email EU Communication Network

# Methods
We applied the algorithm using:
- Spark RDDs
- Spark Dataframes

# Sources

# Credits
This project was made with the contribution of Aicha BOKBOT, Delong LI and Arthur KRIEFF.
